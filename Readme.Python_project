🛒 ZEPTO SALES DATA ANALYSIS PROJECT
📌 PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project focuses on analyzing real-world sales data from Zepto, a quick-commerce platform. The objective was to perform end-to-end data analysis — from raw data cleaning to generating meaningful business insights using Python.

The dataset contains 200,000+ transactional records along with product catalog information. The project demonstrates practical implementation of data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), aggregation, and visualization techniques.

📂 Dataset Description

The project uses two datasets:

1️⃣ zepto_sales.csv – Transactional Sales Data
Column Name	Description
order_id	Unique order identifier
order_date	Date and time of order
product_id	Product identifier
quantity	Units sold
city	City where order was placed
delivery_status	Delivered / Cancelled / Returned
customer_id	Customer identifier
delivery_time_mins	Delivery time in minutes
total_amount	Total transaction amount
2️⃣ zepto_products.csv – Product Catalog Data
Column Name	Description
product_id	Unique product identifier
product_name	Name of product
category	Product category
base_price	Base price of product

🔎 Project Workflow
✅ 1. Data Loading & Exploration

Loaded datasets using Pandas

Inspected shape, columns, and data types

Generated summary statistics

Identified missing values and duplicates

✅ 2. Data Cleaning

Removed rows with missing values in city and delivery_status

Filled missing values in delivery_time_mins using mean

Removed duplicate records

Converted order_date to datetime format

✅ 3. Data Analysis

Performed aggregation and grouping to derive insights such as:

Minimum, maximum, and average transaction value

Top 5 revenue-generating products

Total sales by city

Average delivery time by city

Monthly sales trends

Category-wise revenue contribution

✅ 4. Data Visualization

Created meaningful visualizations including:

📊 Bar Charts – Top products & city-wise sales

📈 Line Chart – Monthly sales trend

🥧 Pie Chart – Category contribution

📉 Histogram – Delivery time distribution

📊 Key Insights

Identified highest revenue-generating products

Determined top-performing cities based on sales

Evaluated delivery performance across cities
