                                                      ZEPTO DATA ANALYST PROJECT USING PYTHON
                                             ---------------------------------------------------------

In this project, I worked on real-world sales data from Zepto, 
which included two datasets — one containing over 200,000 sales transactions 
and another containing product details. First, I loaded both CSV files using pandas 
and performed initial exploration to understand the structure, columns, data types, 
and overall shape of the datasets. After that, I cleaned the data by handling missing values, 
I removed rows where city and delivery status were missing and filled missing delivery time values using the mean. 
I also checked and removed duplicate records to ensure data accuracy and converted the order date column into datetime format for time-based analysis. 
Once the data was clean, I performed analysis using groupby and aggregation functions to calculate minimum, maximum,
and average sales amount, identify the top 5 products by total sales, analyze total sales by city, calculate average delivery time by city, 
examine monthly sales trends, and determine sales by product category by merging both datasets.
Finally, I visualized these insights using matplotlib and seaborn by creating bar charts, line graphs, pie charts,
and histograms to make the results easy to understand and interpret. Through this project,
I followed the complete data analysis workflow from data cleaning to visualization and generated meaningful business insights from raw sales data.
